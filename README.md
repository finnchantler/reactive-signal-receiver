# reactive-signal-receiver

---
Java application built using Project Reactor to process messages from [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) in a non-blocking manner.

signal-cli will be instantiated as a subprocess and the receiver class will read from the signal-cli output stream

Hoping to implement a RESTful API with Spring WebFlux to interact with this in the future...
